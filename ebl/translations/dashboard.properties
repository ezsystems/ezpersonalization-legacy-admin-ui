ab_test_faq_a_1 = AB testing is a method for comparing two variants, A and B, given some specif measure. A and B also known as as the "Control Group" and "Treatment Group". In our context these will be scenario A and Scenario B in which we want to compare.

ab_test_faq_a_2 = This feature enables you to compare the performance of two scenarios. It is also to examine new scenarios over your active users with minor damage in case the new scenario is bad.

ab_test_faq_a_3 = The feature is purely to compare recommendations coming out from two different scenarios. The feature is not for testing a GUI, applying AA tests, or any other non specified purpose.

ab_test_faq_a_4 = <ul><li>Deactivate caching of recommendations for the scenarios you want to compare. Otherwise this leads to wrong results.</li><li>Apply AB testing constantly on your system - these will help you finding the best performing scenarios and improve your system.</li><li>Configure the number of users in the treatment group (Other scenario = Scenario B) to reasonable size, says no more than 20-30% of the users.</li><li>Do not stop the AB testing before the predefined end date. Trends are influenced by different factors (special offers, vacation time, etc.). Therefore we do not present results before the test has finished.</li></ul>

ab_test_faq_a_5 = <ul><li>Compare personalized recommendations with context based recommendations.</li><li>Try out different models, e.g. use click based models, purchase based models or a click-to-purchase model and compare them with each other</li><li>Try out content based models vs. collaborative filtering models</li><li>Test decreasingly weighted popularity vs. normal popularity models, where all events have the same weight.</li><li>Try different timeframes in the model configuration</li><li>Use editorial lists to push products by showing them as static recommendations</li></ul>

ab_test_faq_a_6 = Requirement for an A/B-Test is the choice or creation of a compatible scenario. After that A/B-Tests can be configured via the Link "Create new A/B-Test" on the right side.
