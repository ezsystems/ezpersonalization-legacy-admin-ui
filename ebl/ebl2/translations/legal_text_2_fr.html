<h3>Agreement on Contract Data Processing</h3>

            <p>
            The Recommender Engine facilitates the output of personalized recommendations 
			for Internet application users. To calculate these recommendations, user 
			profiles must be generated. In doing so, the Recommender Engine collects 
			data on the user’s actions during usage in the Internet application and 
			links them with information on his or her context (e.g. end device, 
			Internet browser). The user profiles are employed as the basis for 
			recommendations to the user and for a design of the Internet applications 
			that is oriented on the user’s interests. 
			
			</p><p>
			In accordance with the contract between 
			YOOCHOOSE and the customer of November 13, 2009 (“ASP Agreement”), YOOCHOOSE 
			operates the Recommender Engine for the customer by means of ASP operation. 
			Identification of individual users or end devices that access the customer’s 
			Internet application is made through anonymous identifiers.
            
			</p><p>
			Based on appropriate technical measures, YOOCHOOSE and the customer ensure 
			that YOOCHOOSE will be unable from a technical standpoint to assign these 
			identifiers to a specific person. As a result, YOOCHOOSE and the customer 
			jointly assume that operation of the Recommender Engine by YOOCHOOSE will 
			not result in the processing of personal information of the users by 
			YOOCHOOSE in terms of data privacy law.
			
			</p><p>
			Due to the restrictive attitudes some supervisory authorities have regarding 
			pseudonym data (e.g. IP addresses), the contractual parties nonetheless conclude 
			this agreement regarding contract data processing and agree to treat the data 
			exchanged and processed during operation of the Recommender Engine in such a 
			manner as if they were person-related data within the meaning of Section 3 para. 
			1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and to fulfill the resulting 
			obligations.
			</p>

            <h4>1 Contract data processing</h4>

            <p>
            1.1 YOOCHOOSE processes the customer’s data (comp. Section 3.1) on behalf 
			of the customer to meet its contractual obligations pursuant to the ASP 
			Agreement.

            </p><p>
            1.2 If, in rendering contractual services (comp. Section 3.2), YOOCHOOSE 
			collects, processes, uses or demands access to the customer’s data, YOOCHOOSE 
			works on the customer’s behalf within the meaning of Section 11 of the German 
			Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The customer is the responsible entity 
			pursuant to Section 3 para. 7 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) 
			and therefore solely responsible for the legality of data processing, specifically 
			compliance with legal permissions or existence of the customer’s proper consent.

            </p><h4>2 Contract term</h4>

            <p>
            The duration of the contract corresponds to the term of the ASP Agreement.

            </p><h4>3 Data processing; data; affected parties</h4>

            <p>

            a. Pseudonymized user identification;
            <br>
            b. Information on content accessed, rated or read by the user, services 
			used by the user, accessed content and entered information, including the 
			corresponding usage frequency.
            <br>
            3.2 During the implementation of the services described in the ASP Agreement 
			(“contract data processing”), YOOCHOOSE processes and uses the customer’s data. 
			Contract data processing includes
            <br>
            a. Transmission of the customer’s data to YOOCHOOSE via a predefined tracking 
			interface as well as via an interface to the customer’s content management system;
            <br>
            b. Calculation of recommendations through the Recommender Engine;
            <br>
            c. Transmission of recommendations to the customer via a predefined 
			recommendation interface.

            </p><h4>4 Instructions by the customer</h4>

            <p>
            YOOCHOOSE may only collect, process and use the customer’s data within the 
			scope of the customer’s instructions. The customer reserves the right to 
			comprehensive instruction regarding the type, extent and method of contract 
			data processing, which the customer can specify in greater detail at any time 
			based on individual instructions.

            </p><p>
            4.2 If YOOCHOOSE believes that an instruction by the customer violates the 
			German Federal Data Protection Act or another data privacy regulation, YOOCHOOSE 
			will immediately advise the customer of this fact in writing. YOOCHOOSE is 
			entitled to refuse the execution of instructions that are in violation of 
			data privacy law.

            </p><h4>5 Transmission of customer data to other countries</h4>

            <p>
            Processing and usage of the customer’s data will only occur in member 
			states of the European Union or in another state which is a party to 
			the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Any transfer to a third 
			country requires prior written consent by the customer and may only 
			occur, if the special prerequisites in Sections 4b and 4c of the German 
			Federal Data Protection Act are met.

            </p><h4>6 Technical and organizational measures</h4>

            <p>
            6.1 YOOCHOOSE is obligated to implement and comply with the technical 
			and organizational measures pursuant to Section 9 of the German Federal 
			Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Appendix 9 of the German Federal Data 
			Protection Act (BDSG).

            </p><p>
            6.2 Prior to the start of contract data processing, YOOCHOOSE will submit 
			in writing to the customer the specific plans for the implementation 
			and compliance with the technical and organizational measures in terms 
			of contract implementation, including the controls to be performed by 
			YOOCHOSE with regard to the legality of data processing and compliance 
			with the technical and organizational measures, and will present these 
			to the customer for inspection (“data security concept”). The customer 
			can verify the correctness and plausibility of the data security concept 
			in accordance with Section 9. 

            </p><p>
            6.3 If this verification in accordance with Section 6.2 reveals that YOOCHOOSE’s 
			specifications are incorrect, incompletely implemented or irreconcilable 
			with the relevant data privacy regulations or this agreement on data privacy, 
			the customer can demand correction of the defect within an appropriate 
			time period.
			
			</p><p>
            6.2, If the verification in accordance with Section 6.2 results in no objections, 
			the customer shall confirm YOOCHOOSE’s data security concept in writing. With this 
			written confirmation, the data security concept will become binding for both 
			contractual parties and part of this agreement on data privacy.

            </p><p>
            6.5 YOOCHOOSE is entitled and obligated to further develop the technical and 
			organizational measures described in this data security concept in accordance 
			with technological progress. If applicable, YOOCHOOSE will submit the corresponding 
			proposals to the customer. These proposals shall become binding when the customer 
			confirms them in writing. Sections 6.2 to 6.4 apply accordingly.
            </p>
			
			<h4>7 Reporting requirements</h4>

            <p>
            YOOCHOOSE is obligated to provide the customer with the information

            <p>
            YOOCHOOSE may only correct, delete or block the customer’s data upon 
			instruction by the customer. Based on an instruction by the customer, 
			YOOCHOOSE is obligated to perform the corresponding correction, deletion 
			or blocking. If an affected party directly contacts YOOCHOOSE for the 
			purpose of correction or deletion of his or her data, YOOCHOOSE will 
			immediately forward this request to the customer.

			in No. 6 of the Appendix to Section 9 of the German Federal Data Protection 
			Act (BDSG) or have it performed by controllers to be designated in individual 
			cases. In agreement with YOOCHOOSE, the customer may make accompanied visits 
			to the premises of YOOCHOOSE during normal business hours for random checks 
			on the company’s compliance with data privacy regulations and this agreement 
			on contract data processing.

            </p><p>
            9.2 If technical and organizational measures do not pertain to the specific 
			order implementation, the contractual parties can replace monitoring pursuant 
			to Section 9.1 by YOOCHOOSE submitting to the customer current certificates, 
			reports or report extracts by independent entities (e.g. auditors, data
			privacy officers, IT security department, data privacy auditors, quality 
			auditors) or appropriate certification through IT security or data privacy 
			audits (e.g. according to IT-Grundschutz (IT Baseline Protection)).

			data must be obligated in writing to maintain data secrecy and instructed on 
			the data protection obligations resulting from the legal data privacy 
			regulations and this agreement on contract data processing as well as the 
			existing obligation regarding instruction and purpose. This instruction

			declarations by YOOCHOOSE. YOOCHOOSE may only allow contact with the 
			customer’s data to such employees for whose job responsibilities such 
			contact is necessary.

            </p><p>
            10.3 Immediate information of the customer on monitoring actions and 
			measures of the supervisory authority pursuant to Section 38 of the 
			German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). This also applies if an 
			authority in charge pursuant to Sections 43 and 44 of the German 
			Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) investigates at YOOCHOOSE.

            </p><p>
            10.4 Implementation of the controls stipulated in the data security

            </p><h4>11 Subcontracting relationships</h4>

            <p>
            11.1 The involvement of subcontractors in contract data processing by 
			YOOCHOOSE requires the prior written consent of the customer. In this case, 
			YOOCHOOSE is obligated to ensure that the rules of this agreement on contract 
			data processing also apply to the subcontractor. YOOCHOOSE must regularly 
			monitor compliance with these obligations. YOOCHOOSE ensures that the 
			customer also has monitoring rights with the subcontractor in accordance 
			with this agreement on contract data processing and Section 11 of the German 
			Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) in conjunction with No. 6 of the Appendix 
			to Section 9 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

			or provisions in this agreement on contract data processing.

            <p>
            12.2 The contractual parties are aware that pursuant to Section 42 a of 
			the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) there may be information 
			obligations in the case of loss or illegal transmission or gaining knowledge 
			of personal information. YOOCHOOSE is obligated to notify the customer of 
			such incidents immediately and without regard of causation. This also 
			applies to severe disruptions of operations, for suspicion of other 
			violations of the protection of personal information or other irregularities 
			in the handling of the customer’s data. The notification must include all 
			information the customer requires to meet his information obligation 
			pursuant to Section 42 a of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), 
			if this information is available at YOOCHOOSE or can be identified by YOOCHOOSE 
			with a reasonable effort. In coordination with the customer, 
			YOOCHOOSE must take appropriate measures to reduce any potential 
			disadvantageous consequences for any affected parties.
