
              <h3>Data Privacy Information Regarding Usage Of The Recommender Engine</h3>

              <p>
              The Recommender Engine facilitates the output of personalized recommendations 
			  for Internet application users. To calculate these recommendations, 
			  user profiles must be generated. In doing so, the Recommender Engine 
			  collects data on the user’s actions during usage in the Internet application 
			  and links them with information on his or her context (e.g. end device, 
			  Internet browser). The user profiles are employed as the basis for recommendations 
			  to the user and for a design of the Internet applications that is oriented on 
			  the user’s interests.

              </p><p>
              When the Recommender Engine is operated on the servers of YOOCHOOSE 
			  (e.g. based on ASP operation), YOOCHOOSE will generate user profiles 
			  on the basis of anonymous identifiers on your behalf. These anonymous 
			  identifiers facilitate clear identification of a user or end device over 
			  a longer time period and multiple sessions. Typically, such identifiers 
			  are generated and managed through a user administration in the customer’s 
			  Internet application. If the use of the Internet application is also 
			  possible without authentication of the user’s identify via a login 
			  procedure, browser-based identification systems such as cookies are 
			  typically used.

              </p><h4>1 Data processing by YOOCHOOSE</h4>

              <p>
              When the Recommender Engine is operated on the servers of YOOCHOOSE 
			  (e.g. based on ASP operation), YOOCHOOSE will generate user profiles on 
			  the basis of anonymous identifiers on your behalf. These anonymous identifiers 
			  facilitate clear identification of a user or end device over a longer time 
			  period and multiple sessions. Typically, such identifiers are generated and 
			  managed through a user administration in the customer’s Internet application. 
			  If the use of the Internet application is also possible without authentication 
			  of the user’s identify via a login procedure, browser-based identification 
			  systems such as cookies are typically used.

              </p><p>
              YOOCHOOSE receives from you neither the name nor the IP address or other 
			  information that allows the identification of individual users. YOOCHOOSE 
			  is unable to assign the identifiers established for the user profiles to 
			  individual users. This is exclusively possible for you due to your existing 
			  reference tables, e.g. through user administration or a cookie.

              </p><p>
              Despite this wide-ranging anonymization, YOOCHOOSE cannot exclude that 
			  operation of the Recommender Engine is viewed as the processing of personal 
			  information by the data protection supervisory authorities. According to 
			  the opinion of some data protection supervisory authorities, a piece of 
			  information is already considered person-related, if attribution to a certain 
			  individual is possible with the help of third-party information. As a result, 
			  in reference to the Recommender Engine, it can suffice if you have a reference 
			  table that allows assignment of user profiles.
              </p><p>

              In light of this situation, YOOCHOOSE insists on concluding an agreement 
			  for contract data processing pursuant to Section 11 of the German Federal 
			  Data Protection Act (BDSG), if YOOCHOOSE operates the Recommender Engine 
			  for you.

              </p><h4>2 Legality of the generation of user profiles with the Recommender 
			  Engine</h4>

              <p>	
              The generation of user profiles by the operators of Internet applications is 
			  governed in Section 15 para. 3 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to 
			  this section, profile generation without the user’s consent is only permitted 
			  if made based on the use of pseudonyms (see Section 1 a). The user has the right 
			  to object to the generation of the profile and must be informed of this right 
			  at the start of usage (see Section 1 b). If the user profile is to be combined 
			  with person-related information of the user, prior consent by the user is 
			  required (see Section 2).

              </p><p>
              <b>1. Profile generation without consent</b>

              </p><p>
              <b>a) Use of pseudonyms</b>

              </p><p>
              According to Section 15 para. 3 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG), providers 
			  of telemedia may employ usage data for purposes of advertising, market research 
			  or the appropriate design of telemedia to generate user profiles, if this 
			  occurs through the use of pseudonyms and if the user does not object.
              </p><p>

              Usage data in this context are specifically:
              </p><p>

              1. Characteristics for identification of the user;
              <br>
              2. Information on the beginning and end as well as the extent of the usage in 
			  question; and
              <br>
              3. Information on the telemedia used by the user.

              </p><p>
              Pursuant to Section 1 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG), telemedia are 
			  all electronic information and communications services that do not constitute 
			  telecommunications services or broadcasts. This especially includes applications 
			  in the field of e-commerce, data services or opinion forums. Internet applications 
			  that use the Recommender Engine are typically telemedia in terms of the law.

              </p><p>
              Accordingly, the generation of user profiles as facilitated by the Recommender 
			  Engine is only possible, if it occurs through the use of pseudonyms. As a result, 
			  you must not link the user profile to information that allows identification 
			  of the user. According to the opinion of the data protection supervisory 
			  authorities, apart from the user’s name and address, dynamic IP addresses 
			  are also included in the information that allows identification. Assignment 
			  of the user profile to the IP address of a user is therefore illegal without 
			  the consent of the user. This also applies, if the user has not registered 
			  with you and you therefore do not know the user’s name and address.

              </p><p>
              Therefore, identification of the user profiles provided by the Recommender 
			  Engine may only be made through pseudonym identifiers. The circumstance 
			  that you can assign the pseudonyms to person-related data of the user 
			  through a reference file does not run counter to the legality of profile 
			  generation pursuant to Section 15 para. 3 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). 
			  However, such an assignment must not actually occur. You must ensure this 
			  separation through appropriate technical and organizational measures, so 
			  that such a link can not occur by accident either (comp. Section 13 para. 
			  4 no. 6 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG)). We would be happy to make 
			  suggestions as to how this can be accomplished with relatively small 
			  technical effort.

              </p><p>
              The generation of user profiles and therefore usage of the Recommender 
			  Engine must not occur with regard to users who have objected to profile 
			  generation. The users must be advised of this right to object. This can
			  be achieved as part of the required advisory on data processing (see b) 
			  below).

              </p><p>
              <b>b) Advisory</b>

              </p><p>
              According to Section 13 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG), 
			  you are obligated to notify the user at the start of the usage process 
			  on the type, extent and purposes of the collection and use of his or her 
			  personal information in a generally understandable form, unless such 
			  instruction has already been made. For an automated procedure that 
			  facilitates the later identification of the user and prepares the 
			  collection or use of personal information, the user must be informed 
			  at the start of this procedure.

              </p><p>
              In practice, this notification is usually made in the form of a data 
			  privacy declaration that can be accessed from the start page of the 
			  website and all subsequent pages via an easily recognizable link. For 
			  example, for the use of the Recommender Engine in the manner described 
			  in a) the following information can be included:

              </p><p>
              “We capture and store various pieces of information that you transmit 
			  to us on our website or in a different way. This includes in particular

              </p><p>
              - Information on the end device or Internet browser you use;
              <br>
              - The services you used, the content you accessed and the orders you 
			  entered, including the corresponding usage frequency.

              </p><p>
              We use cookies to identify your computer and to assign the information 
			  we have stored. Cookies are small files that we store on your computer 
			  and that our website reads with every visit. In part, cookies are 
			  stored over the course of multiple sessions. This way, we can recognize 
			  your computer if you revisit our website after the termination of one 
			  session.

              </p><p>
              You can prevent the storage of cookies on your computer through the 
			  corresponding settings in your Internet browser. It is also possible

			  please consult the user instructions of your Internet browser.

              </p><p>
              We use these data and cookies in order to better gear the Internet 
			  services used by you to your interests and to recommend to you products 
			  or services that could interest you. These data are stored and used 
			  exclusively through the use of pseudonyms. The cookies we stored do 
			  not contain any personal information either. No link with data 
			  facilitating your identification, especially with your IP address, 
			  is made.

              </p><p>
              You can object to the storage and use of your information for these 
			  purposes anytime and free of charge. Your objection must be addressed 
			  to:

              </p><p>
              [Contacting options for the user. In practice, frequently a link is 
			  offered through which the user can automatically switch off any 
			  additional profile generation.].“

              </p><p>
              <b>2. Profile generation with consent</b>

              </p><p>
              If the prerequisites of Section 15 para. 3 of the German Telemedia Act 
			  (TMG) represented in Section 1 are not met, the generation of user 
			  profiles as facilitated by the Recommender Engine is only legal with 
			  the user’s consent. This applies especially if the user profiles are 
			  to be assigned to a user account that contains information on the user, 
			  e.g. his or her name, address or IP address. Even if your Internet 
			  application does not provide for a user account, consent is required 
			  if the user profile is linked to the user’s IP address.

              </p><p>
              The consent must meet the requirements in terms of data privacy and 
			  general civil law. It must effectively be included in the contractual 
			  relationship with the user. A comprehensive representation of all 
			  requirements to be observed in this respect can not be provided.

              </p><p>
              You can integrate the user’s declaration of consent for the Recommender 
			  Engine into the legal data privacy declarations that are required of 
			  your users anyway. For example, the consent clause with regard to the 
			  Recommender Engine can be phrased as follows:

              </p><p>
              “The user consents to provider data generated during the use of the 
			  Internet services being used for the design of the Internet services 
			  based on the needs of the user and for the personalized recommendation 
			  of products and services. These usage data include specifically

              </p><p>
              - Information on the end device and Internet browser used by the user;
              <br>
              - Services used, content accessed and orders entered by the user, 
			  including the corresponding usage frequency.

              </p><p>
              The user also consents to [provider] storing these usage data together with 
			  additional personal information for the above-mentioned purposes.

              </p><p>
              The details of data processing are explained in the data protection 
			  declaration.

              </p><p>
              The user can revoke this consent anytime and free of charge. The 
			  revocation must be addressed to:

              </p><p>
              [Contacting options for the user. In practice, frequently a link 
			  is offered through which the user can automatically switch off 
			  any additional profile generation.].“

              </p><p>
              If cookies are also used apart from user identification through the 
			  login process, this should also be incorporated in the consent wording, 
			  since cookies represent personal information to you, if you are able 
			  to assign it to a specific user. We would be happy to discuss the 
			  details with you during concrete project implementation.

              </p><p>
              Even if the user gives his or her consent, he or she must be informed 
			  on the type, extent and purposes of data processing. This must be done 
			  before he or she gives his or her consent. For this purpose, it makes 
			  sense to refer to the data protection declaration in the consent clause. 
			  The required information in the data protection declaration depends 
			  on the specific design of your Internet application, specifically 
			  which personal information you link to the user profile. In any case, 
			  the sample wording provided in 1. b) will not suffice. The final 
			  wording should be phrased with the involvement of a corporate data 
			  protection officer and an attorney experienced in data privacy law. 
			  If you need additional information in this respect, we would be happy 
			  to assist you.

              </p><p>
              We would like to point out that the information provided in this 
			  document merely represents initial guidance on the classification 
			  of the Recommender Engine in terms of data privacy law. An exact 
			  assessment in terms of data privacy law must be performed in each 
			  individual case based on the specific technical circumstances. We 
			  would like to point out that the information in this document can 
			  not replace sound legal advice by an attorney.
